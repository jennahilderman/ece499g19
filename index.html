            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The global demand for renewable energy sources is increasing as the world seeks sustainable solutions to combat climate change. Solar energy, one of the most abundant and accessible sources of renewable energy, has become a key focus for innovation and development. Solar panels, however, face the challenge of efficiently converting sunlight into electrical energy under varying environmental conditions. To address this challenge, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technology has been developed.</p>
            <p>MPPT solar charge controllers play a crucial role in optimizing the performance of solar panels. By continuously adjusting the operating point of the panels, these controllers ensure that the panels operate at their maximum power point, regardless of changes in sunlight intensity, temperature, or other environmental factors. This optimization can lead to a significant increase in energy conversion efficiency, often by 30-40% compared to traditional methods.</p>
            <p>The significance of MPPT technology extends beyond efficiency gains. It enables more reliable and consistent energy production, which is essential for off-grid living and remote applications where stable power supply is critical. Moreover, the improved efficiency translates to reduced costs and smaller system sizes, making solar energy systems more accessible and practical for a wider range of users.</p>
            <p>This project aims to design and build an efficient MPPT solar charge controller. By leveraging the latest advancements in power electronics and microcontroller technology, our goal is to develop a solution that not only enhances energy conversion efficiency but also provides a robust and user-friendly interface for monitoring and control. The successful implementation of this project will contribute to the broader adoption of solar energy, supporting global efforts towards a sustainable future.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Our design involves building an MPPT solar charge controller that works with a solar panel or array of panels to charge a battery. The MPPT controller continuously tracks the maximum power point of the solar panels and adjusts the PWM duty cycle of the synchronous buck converter to ensure optimal voltage and efficient battery charging.</p>
