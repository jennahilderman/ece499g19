            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The global demand for renewable energy sources is increasing as the world seeks sustainable solutions. Solar energy is one of the most abundant and accessible renewable energy sources. Under varying environmental conditions,  solar panels do not efficiently convert sunlight into electrical energy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                MPPT solar charge controllers optimize solar panel performance by continuously adjusting the panel's operating point to maintain operation at its maximum power point. This point can be affected by changes in sunlight intensity, temperature, or other environmental factors. This optimization can significantly increase energy conversion efficiency.

                MPPT technology is essential for off-grid living and remote applications, enabling more reliable and consistent energy production. This project aims to design an efficient and cost-effective MPPT controller that will improve solar energy production for the average consumer.

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                The ESP32 MCU powers the MPPT solar charge controller and controls a synchronous buck converter that steps the voltage down to the desired charging voltage. The synchronous converter, known for its exceptional efficiency of up to 98%, consistently outperforms asynchronous converters that have an efficiency of up to 80%.
            <p>
                The system features an ACS712 current sensor, a crucial component that provides real-time feedback to the MCU about the current flowing from the solar panels. The MPPT algorithm uses this feedback to adjust the PWM duty cycle dynamically, maintaining the operation at the maximum power point. The system processes the sensor data through an ADS1015 Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

            </div>
            <p>
                The user interface allows users to monitor the charge controller. The MPPT controller sends data to a Blynk application for easy monitoring. The device is housed in a 3D-printed case. Future iterations will improve the interface and the housing for better functionality, durability, and aesthetics.

                This design optimizes energy extraction from the solar panels under varying environmental conditions, significantly enhancing the efficiency and reliability of off-grid solar energy systems.
